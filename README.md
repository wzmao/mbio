## What is **`mbio`**?
   This is a biology python package I used in my working. I will translate some algorithms from other language into python. I will try to make the program fast and easy to use. I mainly working on protein sequence analysis.
   
   Now we have v1.1.1, welcome to download and tell me your feeling.
   
   The package is dependent on numpy and prody.

Now, I have

* MI
* MIp
* OMES
* SCA
* DI
* PSICOV
* DICOV
* APC
* BND
* PPV (for PSICOV)
* Sequence shuffle

We also have some functions for different file formats.

* PDB (which could support the .tar.gz bundle PDB parser and writer.)
* Fasta
* Numpy Matrix
* MRC (support .mrc.gz parser and writer.)

## Usage

I probably will post some examples in the furture.

## Work together

If you are interested in developing, please e-mail me and I will be happy to work together with you.

If you think some algorithms should be added into this package, you could also e-mail me.
